#
# Copies the built site (build_production) to the local review host, by default
# ~/Sites/ui-view.test, served as https://ui-view.test by ServBay. The
# copy is exact (rsync --delete) except for one change in the copy only:
#
# The live examples run in sandboxed srcdoc frames (sandbox="allow-scripts"),
# whose origin is opaque. Chromium's Local Network Access blocks every request
# from an opaque-origin frame to a loopback or private address: scripts,
# stylesheets and fetches fail even with Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so on a
# local host the frame never loads the SIMAI Framework runtime or the set and
# only its static markup shows. A public host is not affected. For the local
# copy the frames also get allow-same-origin: they then run as the site's own
# origin, which the local host serves. The examples are this repository's own
# code. The build itself, and anything deployed from it, keeps Docara's sandbox.
