# Changes

The set `view`, by its npm version `@simai-studio/view`; component versions
in brackets. The site page «Изменения» says the same in Russian.

## Unreleased

- `sf-view-flow` 1.0.0 (preview): a few properties as a block in a
  flow (a chat, a feed): shows a record's fields, or asks for a few and sends
  them, then keeps the answer read-only. Same field descriptors as
  `sf-view-properties`; the answer is the event
  `sf-view-flow-answer {id, accepted, values}` and the host settles
  it with `settle()`. Design: `docs/design/sf-view-flow.md`.
- `sf-view-properties`: the field value moved into `js/field-value.js`,
  shared with the new block; no change in behaviour.
- Built over SIMAI Framework `ui-1e5ec795a1ce` (ui-source `54c89e61ef9b`,
  npm `@simai-studio/ui@5.20261106.1146`, core.runtime 1.30.0), the pair that
  registers `sf-view-flow`; still runs with core.runtime 1.25.0 or newer.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-11-05

- `sf-view` 1.8.1: a table the host wrote `selectable="false"` or
  `settings="false"` on keeps it; the view's chrome wrote over both, and a
  list came back with row boxes and a settings column (Larena, the sites
  list).
- `sf-view-table` 1.15.0: dates, dates with a time and times the host does
  not format read in the page's language (SIMAI Framework `format-date`); an
  `html` cell shows its text, not its markup; a cell of several files shows
  each file's name with its icon (it was empty); the settings column is left
  out when it would open nothing (no column settings, no row actions, no row
  reordering).
- `sf-view-properties` 1.10.0: a `datetime` and a `time` are edited with one
  `sf-input-date` (mode `datetime`, `time`) instead of the view's own pair;
  dates shown read in the page's language; a colour palette wraps inside a
  half-width field; a closed panel draws nothing (its close button and shadow
  stayed over the page); a value brought back to what the record holds is no
  change.
- Same SIMAI Framework pair `ui-62b1d9b6dc8d`; needs core.runtime 1.25.0 or
  newer.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-05

- First version of the set: `sf-view` (1.8.0), `sf-view-table` (1.14.0) and
  `sf-view-properties` (1.9.1), moved from the SIMAI Pro package (ui-pro
  `c2a3b48d140f`) with no change in behaviour.
- Built over SIMAI Framework `ui-62b1d9b6dc8d` (ui-source `ec2f29dfa5df`,
  core.runtime 1.28.0); needs core.runtime 1.25.0 or newer.
- Former tags `sf-data-view`, `sf-table`, `sf-property-view` work until
  2027-01-01.
